//! ETDump (ExecuTorch Dump) is one of the core components of the ExecuTorch Developer Tools.
//!
//! It is the mechanism through which all forms of profiling and debugging data is extracted from the runtime.
//! Users canâ€™t parse ETDump directly; instead, they should pass it into the Inspector API, which deserializes the data,
//! offering interfaces for flexible analysis and debugging.
//!
//! Tracing is not fully supported yet.
